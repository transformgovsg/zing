# 0001: Record architecture decisions ✍️

## Status

✅ Accepted

## 🤔 Context

When multiple engineers contribute to a project, or when revisiting past decisions, it's crucial to understand the reasoning behind significant architectural choices. Without explicit documentation, this context can be lost, leading to repeated discussions, difficulty onboarding new team members, and potential inconsistencies in future development.

## 🎯 Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. ADRs will be stored as markdown files in the `docs/adr` directory. Each ADR will follow a simple template including:

- **Title:** A short, descriptive title for the decision.
- **Status:** The current status (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded).
- **Context:** The problem or situation that necessitates this decision. What forces are at play?
- **Decision:** The chosen solution or approach. What is the change being made?
- **Consequences:** The expected outcomes, benefits, drawbacks, and trade-offs of this decision. What becomes easier or harder?

ADRs should be numbered sequentially. We will start with this ADR as `0001`.

## ⚖️ Consequences

- **Advantages 👍:**
  - Provides clear documentation of architectural choices and their rationale.
  - Facilitates onboarding of new team members.
  - Helps maintain architectural consistency over time.
  - Avoids relearning or re-debating past decisions.
- **Disadvantages 👎:**
  - Requires discipline to create and maintain ADRs.
  - Adds a small overhead to the decision-making process.
- **Neutral Considerations 👀:**
  - ADRs capture the _why_ behind a decision at a point in time; the codebase remains the source of truth for the _what_ and _how_.
